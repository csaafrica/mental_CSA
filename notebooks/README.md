## Projects

Projects are a fundamental aspect of the workshop and help students apply data science skills to solve real-world problems. Data scientists are often asked causal questions, such as *does smoking cause cancer?* Our projects will explore how to use data to answer such questions, such as analyzing the impact of immunization on the economy, evidencing climate change's effects on health, predicting outbreaks, and more.
